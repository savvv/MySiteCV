Comments allow you to leave notes in your code for yourself or 
another developer, or to temporarily deactivate sections of code 
for debugging. Or, you might assign someone a task or point out 
an error for them with a comment.In short, commenting
 in HTML helps you work smarter when building or debugging a website, and it’s easy to do. Next, let’s learn how.
